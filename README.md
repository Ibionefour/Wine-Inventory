# Wine-Inventory 
The aim for this Wine inventory system is to add and store record of any wine of your choice to a txt file to demonstrate fundamental understading of OOP.
 Main functionaility includes, load wine from a txt file, add records of wine at a time to the file, search wine by id and save wines based on user input as it is a console program. The three feature to meet the the requirment includ :
 creating a wine list to populate it with data to use throughout the program.
 implementing a master while loop where user has options to perform functions such as loading the txt file, adding wine record, searching wine records by id and saving the data before exiting the program.
 loading user input data to a txt file and allowing the ability to read and write the data that is loaded.
 
Files include Wine.s which is an entry point to the progam when it's run but WineLogic.cs stores all the logic, blue print and methods.

Insturuction to open the project -simply clone the file or copy it to your visual studio environment and run it. 

IMPORTANT - To ensure loading data from file, and some wine records first, save them and use the load functionality. It may not work intially if you are pulling or cloning the repo.
